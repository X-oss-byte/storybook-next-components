### API Reference

The following section contains a comprehensive list of the component's references, including descriptions, properties, types, and default behavior. This information is readily available for you to access, helping you effectively utilize the component library in your projects.

#### Heading

It inherits all the properties of @expo/html-elements's [H1](https://github.com/expo/expo/tree/main/packages/html-elements) component.

### Examples

The Examples section provides visual representations of the different variants of the component, allowing you to quickly and easily determine which one best fits your needs. Simply copy the code and integrate it into your project.

#### Heading Sizes

Heading component offers a range of sizes, including `xs`, `sm`, `md`, `lg`, `xl`, `2xl`, `3xl`, `4xl`, and `5xl`, allowing users to customize the size of the heading according to their design requirements. The size attribute determines which HTML tag (`h1` to `h6`) will be rendered. For `5xl`, `4xl`, and `3xl`, it renders `h1`. For `2xl`, it renders `h2`. For xl, it renders `h3`. For `lg`, it renders `h4`. For `md`, it renders `h5`. Finally, for `sm` and `xs`, it renders `h6`.

<AppProvider>
  <CodePreview
    _rendererWrapper={{ py: '$2.5' }}
    showComponentRenderer={true}
    showArgsController={false}
    metaData={{
      code: `
function App() {
  const sizes = [
    'xs',
    'sm',
    'md',
    'lg',
    'xl',
    '2xl',
    '3xl',
    '4xl',
    '5xl',
  ];
  return (
    <Wrapper>
      <Center>
        {sizes.map((size) => (
          <Heading size={size}>{size}</Heading>
        ))}
      </Center>
    </Wrapper>
  );
};
`,
      scope: { Wrapper, Center, Heading },
      argsType: {},
    }}
  />
</AppProvider>

## Advanced

We provide in-depth information on how to customize and extend the component's functionality to meet your needs. Below, we describe how to modify the component to suit your requirements.

### Customizing the Heading

For customizing the Heading, you have to map styled view to Heading. You can refer [style.gluestack.io](https://style.gluestack.io/) for more information on how to use styled components.

#### Usage

Default styling of the component can be found in the `components/core/heading` file. For reference, you can view the [source code](https://github.com/gluestack/gluestack-ui/tree/main/example/storybook/src/ui-components/Heading) of the styled `Heading` component.

```jsx
// import the styles
import { Root } from '../components/core/heading/styled-components';

// mapping the Heading to root component
const Heading = Root;

// Using the heading component
export default () => <Heading />;
```
