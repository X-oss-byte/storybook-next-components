### API Reference

The following section contains a comprehensive list of the component's references, including descriptions, properties, types, and default behavior. This information is readily available for you to access, helping you effectively utilize the component library in your projects.

#### Text

It inherits all the properties of React Native's [Text](https://reactnative.dev/docs/text) component.

### Examples

The Examples section provides visual representations of the different variants of the component, allowing you to quickly and easily determine which one best fits your needs. Simply copy the code and integrate it into your project.

#### Text Sizes

Text component comes in different sizes, such as `xs`, `sm`, `md`, `lg`, `xl`, `2xl`, `3xl`, `4xl`, `5xl`, and `6xl` allowing users to adjust the button size based on their design needs.

<AppProvider>
  <CodePreview
    _rendererWrapper={{ py: '$2.5' }}
    showComponentRenderer={true}
    showArgsController={false}
    metaData={{
      code: `
function App() {
  const sizes = [
    'xs',
    'sm',
    'md',
    'lg',
    'xl',
    '2xl',
    '3xl',
    '4xl',
    '5xl',
    '6xl',
  ];
  return (
    <Center>
      {sizes.map((size) => (
        <Text size={size}>{size}</Text>
      ))}
    </Center>
  );
};
`,
      transformCode: (code) => {
        return transformedCode(code);
      },
      scope: { Wrapper, Center, Text },
      argsType: {},
    }}
  />
</AppProvider>

## Advanced

We provide in-depth information on how to customize and extend the component's functionality to meet your needs. Below, we describe how to modify the component to suit your requirements.

### Customizing the Text

For customizing the Text, you have to map styled view to Text. You can refer [style.gluestack.io](https://style.gluestack.io/) for more information on how to use styled components.

#### Usage

Default styling of the component can be found in the `components/core/text` file. For reference, you can view the [source code](https://github.com/gluestack/gluestack-ui/tree/main/example/storybook/src/ui-components/Text) of the styled `Text` component.

```jsx
// import the styles
import { Root } from '../components/core/text/styled-components';

// mapping the Text to root component
const Text = Root;

// Using the text component
export default () => <Text />;
```
