Detecting width type of an layer:

Step 1 - If parent layer's width is equal to current layer's width and parent layer's   width type is "FIXED", then current layer's type will be "FILLED".

Step 2: If current layer's width is equal to it's child width then current layer's width type will be 'HUG'. But if child has display flex, then child's width will always match current layer's width as its child will take available space. SO in this case current layer should be "FIXED". 

<!-- BLOCKER -->
So here question is how will we determine that the child is taking parent's available space or parent is wrapping around child's fixed space. As we can just access computedStyles, which returns width directly in pixel. So the problem is how to detect weather it was passed hard-codely or was it auto-calculated.

<!-- CASE 1: When parent width is fixed and child takes the available space -->
<Box bg='$red500' w={600}> // FIXED
  <Box bg='$blue500' h={200} /> // FILL 
</Box>

<!-- CASE 2: When parent wraps around it's child with fixed width -->
<Box bg='$red500' w='fit-content'> // HUG
  <Box bg='$blue500' h={200} w={600} /> // FIXED
</Box>


Step 3: If step 1 and step 2 doesn't satisfy then it is "FIXED".
